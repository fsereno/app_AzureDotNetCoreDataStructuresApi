# app_AzureDotNetCoreDataStructuresApi
## Azure Functions application

With this application I am demonstrating knowledge of the data structures, Queue and Stack. With Queue being first in, first out and Stack being last in, first out.

### Explanation ###

Using Generics in .NET I have implemented an interface, which acts as the contract to allow for a polymorphic nature when instructing the Queue and Stack structures to add and remove items.
